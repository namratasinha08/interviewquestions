<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

<blockquote>

- In a microservices architecture, each microservice typically runs in its own process or container, with its own memory space and thread pool. As such, it is not possible for one microservice to directly throw an exception to another microservice.
- However, when there  is an interservice communication there is a chance that microservice might throw an error  message for the request  recieved from the other microservice.

For example:

Consider a Cart service and Inventory service, if the user wants to place an order for a product in cart and whene order sevice or cart service comunicates with inventory service a custom exception can be thrown like product out of stock.

A microservice is a small and independent software component that performs a specific function within a larger application or system. It communicates with other microservices through lightweight protocols and is designed to be loosely coupled and independently deployable.

1. Do you know about Microservices.

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

Microservices are a software architecture pattern. In this pattern, the applications are built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Each service is used to perform a specific business logic. The different services in the microservice architecture are independent of each other. because of which the services can be developed and tested independently. The microservice architecture improves the scalability and flexibility of the application.

2. What is your opinion on microservices vs monolithic?;

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

In monolithic architecture, all the functionalities of the application are handled in a single codebase. Which makes it easy to develop, test, and deploy. However, monolithic architecture can become difficult to maintain, and time-consuming to deploy as new functionalities are added into the application.

In a microservice architecture, the codebase is divided into smaller, loosely-coupled services. Each service can be developed and scaled independently. This approach can improve the flexibility and scalability of the application.

Monolithic architecture can be a good choice for small-scale applications while microservices architecture can be a good choice for large and complex applications.

3. Scalability of microservices vs Monolithic.

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>


The microservices architecture supports horizontal scalling meaning that additional instances of a service can be added to handle increased load. on the other hand, the monolitic architecture can only be scaled vertically and it become difficult to manage the application as it grows in size and complexity.

4. How microservices communicate.

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

Microservices use APIs to communicate with each other, typically over HTTP or REST protocols. When one microservice needs to communicate with another, it sends a request to the appropriate endpoint of the other service. The response contains any necessary data. Microservices can communicate synchronously or asynchronously, and may use service registries or discovery mechanisms to locate and communicate with each other dynamically.

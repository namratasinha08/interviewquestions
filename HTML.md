<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

<blockquote>

XHTML is used in many of the same ways as HTML, such as for creating and structuring content for web pages and other types of documents that can be displayed in a web browser. However, because XHTML follows stricter rules for syntax and formatting, it is often used in situations where interoperability with other XML-based tools and technologies is important, such as in web services, mobile applications, and other types of distributed systems.

| HTML                                                                                    | XHTML                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTML syntax is relatively simple                                                     | XHTML syntax is stricter and more standardized, which makes it easier to create consistent, interoperable web pages and documents. |
| HTML allows for shorthand syntax, such as omitting end tags or attributes.              | XHTML does not allow for shorthand syntax, and requires all tags to be properly nested and closed.                                 |
| HTML does not require all elements to have a closing tag.                               | XHTML requires all elements to be properly closed.                                                                                 |
| HTML allows for empty elements, such as ``` <br>```, which do not need a closing tag. | XHTML does not allow for empty elements, and requires all elements to have either content or attributes.                           |
| HTML is not case-sensitive.                                                             | XHTML is case-sensitive, and all tags and attributes must be written in lowercase.                                                 |
| HTML allows for multiple root elements, such as ``` <body>``` and ``` <head>```.    | XHTML requires all documents to have a single root element.                                                                        |
| HTML has a less strict syntax for character encoding.                                   | XHTML requires all documents to have a specified character encoding.                                                               |
| HTML has looser rules for entity references, such as ``` &nbsp;```.                   | XHTML requires all entity references to be properly defined.                                                                       |
| HTML has limited support for internationalization and accessibility.                    | XHTML has better support for internationalization and accessibility.                                                               |
| HTML can be mixed with scripting languages, such as JavaScript.                         | XHTML does not allow for mixing markup with scripting languages.                                                                   |
| HTML is not an XML-based language.                                                      | XHTML is an XML-based language.                                                                                                    |

In HTML, the `<div>` tag is short for "division" and is used to define a container or a section of a web page. It is a block-level element that can be used to group together other HTML elements, such as text, images, and other elements, and apply styles to them as a group.

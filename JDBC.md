1. how to connect to a database and create query in jdbc?

<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

<blockquote>

To connect to a database and create queries using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), you can follow these steps:

1. **Add suitable database connector  depedency:**  Add suitable database connector  depedency should be added in pom.xml file. For example, `mysql connector` for MySQL.
2. **Load the JDBC driver:** You need to load the driver class for the database you want to connect to. For example, for MySQL, you can load the driver with the following code:

```java
Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
```
- Since Java 1.6, JDBC 4.0 API, there is no need to load the driver explicitly. So the above step can be avoided

3. **Create a connection:** Use the DriverManager.getConnection() method to create a connection object, passing in the URL of the database, the username, and the password.

For MySQL:

```java
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
String username = "root";
String password = "mypassword";
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
```

4. **Create a statement:** Use the Connection.createStatement() method to create a statement object that you can use to execute queries.

```java
Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
```
5. **Execute a query:** Use the Statement.executeQuery() method to execute a SELECT query and retrieve the results.

```java
Execute a query: Use the Statement.executeQuery() method to execute a SELECT query and retrieve the results.
```
6. **Process the results:** Use the ResultSet object to iterate over the results and extract the data.

```java
while (resultSet.next()) {
    int id = resultSet.getInt("id");
    String name = resultSet.getString("name");
}
```

7. **Close the resources:** Finally, close the ResultSet, Statement, and Connection objects when you're done using them.

```java
resultSet.close();
statement.close();
connection.close();
```

2. describe the parts of JDBC.


<details><summary></summary>

<blockquote>

JDBC, or Java Database Connectivity, is a Java API that provides a standard interface for connecting Java applications to relational databases. The JDBC API consists of several parts, including:

1. **Driver Manager:** This is the central part of the JDBC API that manages the drivers used to connect to databases. It provides methods for registering and retrieving drivers, and for establishing and closing database connections.

2. **Driver:** A JDBC driver is a software component that allows Java applications to interact with a specific type of database. Each driver is designed to work with a particular type of database management system (DBMS), such as Oracle, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.

3. **Connection:** A connection represents a session between a Java application and a database. It provides methods for executing SQL statements and retrieving results.

4. **Statement:** A statement is an object that represents an SQL statement to be executed against a database. There are three types of statements in JDBC: Statement, PreparedStatement, and CallableStatement.

5. **ResultSet:** A ResultSet is an object that represents a set of rows returned by an SQL query. It provides methods for iterating over the rows and retrieving values from each column.

6. **ResultSetMetaData:** This is an object that provides information about the columns in a ResultSet, such as the name, data type, and size.

7. **SQLException:** An SQLException is an exception that is thrown when an error occurs while accessing a database. It provides information about the error, such as an error code and a message.

Together, these parts of the JDBC API provide a powerful and flexible interface for accessing relational databases from Java applications.

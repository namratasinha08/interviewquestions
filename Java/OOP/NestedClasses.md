3. What is Anonymous Inner class?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)



<details><summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>

>Anonymous Inner class as the name clearly implies is a class inside a class without a name. A single object is created for an anonymous inner class and it's mostly used to override methods of a class or interface for a single instance. Implementation of anonymous inner class is more concise than normal inner class.

4. What is Lambda?

<details><summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>

> Lambda is used to implement a functional Interface( an interface with a single abstract method), before lambda was introduced, one has to use an anonymous inner class to implement the functional interface. lambda expressions made it simple, concise and readable.

<details><summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>

> Anonymous Inner classes are used to create a single instance of class or interface. it makes the code precise and concise.

| A static nested class canâ€™t access the members of the enclosing class directly, an object reference is used to access the members of the enclosing class. | An inner class can directly access all the fields and methods of the enclosed class even if they are private |

7. What is the internal working of the anonymous inner class and how is it different from the normal inner class?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)
<details><summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>

> Anonymous inner class is an inner class with a single instance so an inner class is created by JVM with the name "outerclass$number".

8. What is the Internal working of lambda?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)
<details><summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>

> - Lambda is not an inner class, when the lambda expression is used a private static class with an object return type and Object parameter is created to implement the functional interface.
> - This is the reason why an anonymous class "Outer$1" is not created in the case of the lambda expression.

# problem-Solving
 1. What is the output of the following code?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)



 ``` java
 public class Main {
    public int i = 0;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main m = new Main();
        Main.Nested mn = m. new Nested();
        mn.printVariable(10);   
    }
    class Nested{
        public int i = 2;
        void printVariable(int i)
        {
            System.out.print(i+" ");
            System.out.print(this.i+" ");
            System.out.print(Main.this.i+" ");
        }
    }   
}
```
- A. 0
     2
     10

- B. 10
     2
     0

- C. 0
     10
     2

- D. Compile-time error

<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>


> B

<details><summary><b>Explanation</b></summary>

> The first print statement accesses the argument passed in the `printVriable` method, the second print statement access the intance variable of the Nested class and the third print variable access the instance variable of the Main class( outer class).

2. What is the error in the following code?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)



``` java 
interface Shape{
	void area();
	void circuference();
}

public class Circle{
	
	Shape s = new Shape(){

		@Override
		public void area() {
			System.out.println("area of circle is 3.14*r*r");	
		}	
	};

}

```

<details><summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>

> - A compile time error.
> - It is caused because the anonymous inner class doesn't Implement all the methods of the interface Shape. The method `circuference` is not implemented.

3. What is the output of the following code?

			}
			
			static void printShape()
			{
				System.out.println("I am a Circle");
			}
		};
		
		
		
	}
	
}


```

<details><summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>

> - No output
> - The code gets executed successfully, the anonymous inner class executes all the methods of the interface and the method `printShape()` is a new method created in the anonymous class. Since the anonymous inner class is a class it can implement its own methods.

I am a circle<br>
</blockquote>
<details><summary><b>Explanation</b></summary>
	
<blockquote>
	
- The above code is an example of the static inner class. The `Circle` is the outer class and `SemiCircle` is a static nested class. the method `printShape()` is present in both Circle and SemiCircle and based on the method call the method is implemented.

## Scenario Based

1. Apple launched a new iPhone named iPhone 14 with new features, and it has 3 models, iPhone 14 basic, iPhone 14 pro and iPhone 14 pro max and iPhone 14 mini, which implementation is better for this scenario?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)



- A. an interface iPhone with class iPhone 14 and 4 classes for four models that inherit iPhone 14.
- B. a class iPhone 14 and inner class for each model.
- C. individual classes for every model.
- D. none of the above.

<details><summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>

> B
<details><summary><b>Explanation</b></summary>

> since all the iPhone models are part of iphone14 they can be nested under the class iPhone 14.

2. A DigitalThermometer needs to be configured only once and after that initial configuration, it'll detect the temperature perfectly. Which implementation is better for this scenario?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)



- A. DigitalThermometer class which inherits and overrides the methods of Configuration Class.
- B. DigitalThermometer class which inherits and overrides the methods of the Configuration interface.
- C. DigitalThermometer class which inherits and overrides the methods of Configuration interface using an anonymous inner class.
- D. none of the above.


<details><summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>

> C

<details><summary><b>Explanation</b></summary>
	
> DigitalThermometer(Class), like any other machine, should be configured before being used. Configuration(Interface ) has some procedures ( methods) to configure a machine. any machine is configured only once so we can use an anonymous class to configure DigitalThermometer.

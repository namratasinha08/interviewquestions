<blockquote>

- An expression is madeup of variable, constants and operators.

	**Example**
    ```java
    System.out.println(variable1==variable2);
    ```
- The above statement will return boolean value based whether they are equal or not.

	**Example**

    		`x + y*8 + 5/Z`
- In this expression, we have to seperate them by using brackets else it will executes in bodmos rule.
- We can give the expression using brackets based on our requirements like `(x + y)*((8 + 5)/Z)`

<blockquote>

- A block starts with braces open and end with braces close.
- All the open braces should be balanced by close braces.
    
```java
public class Example {// opening class
	public static void main(String[] args) {// opening method
		System.out.println("Hello");
	}// closing method
}// closing class
```

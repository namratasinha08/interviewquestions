<blockquote>

- When two or more threads are in block state waiting for one another to release the resource that they are having.

- For example, let us assume, we have two processes A1 and A2. Now, process A1 is holding the resource R1 and is waiting for the resource R2. At the same time, the process A2 is having the resource R2 and is waiting for the resource R1. So, no one is releasing any resource, both are waiting for each other to release the resource. This is called deadlock condition.

<blockquote>

In Starvation, Threads are waiting for each other. But waiting time is not infinite after some interval of time, waiting thread gets the resources whatever is required to execute thread `run()` method.

3. How to avoid deadlock in Java?

<blockquote>

- We cannot completely avoid deadlock but can follow these measures to them

    - Avoid Nested Locks - avoid giving locks to multiple threads
    - Avoid Unnecessary Locks - lock is for important thread not for unnecessary threads.
    - Using Thread Join- use Thread.join with a maximum time that a thread will take to avoid a 
      situation where a thread waiting for other thread to relaese.

4. How to detect the deadlock condition?

<blockquote>

Deadlock situations can be detected by running the executable code on `cmd` and subsequently collecting the thread dump. If it occurs, the `cmd` will throw up a message.

5. Write a program to illustrate deadlock condition?

<blockquote>


``` java

class DeadlockSample extends Thread {
    static Thread mainThread;
    public void run()
    {
        System.out.println("Thread2 waiting for" +
                          " Thread1 completion");
        try {
            mainThread.join();
        }
        catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread2 execution" +
                                           " completes");
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args)
                   throws InterruptedException
    {
        DeadlockSample.mainThread = Thread.currentThread();
        DeadlockSample thread = new DeadlockSample();
 
        thread.start();
        System.out.println("Thread1 waiting for " +

    }
}

```

<blockquote>

Here the thread1 will wait for thread2 to complete and thread2 will wait for thread1 to complete, thus the deadlock condition occurs.

6. What may be the reason of deadlock situation?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<blockquote>

Synchronized keyword is the only reason for deadlock situation, which allows only one thread can access the resource at a given point in time.

7. Explain about join method in Java.

<blockquote>

Which allows one thread to wait until another thread completes its execution. which has a void type and throws `InterruptedException`.

8. List the functions used in join method.

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

`join()`- Waits for the thread to die.

`join(long millis)`- Waits at most millis milliseconds for the thread to die.

`join(long millis, int nanos)`- Waits at most millis milliseconds plus nano nanoseconds for the thread 
 to die.

 Which can be declared as

`public final void join()`

`public final void join(long millis, int nanos)`

`public final void join(long millis)`

9. Explain about thread dump

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

- It is a snapshot of the state of all threads in the process. The state of each thread is presented `stack trace`, which shows the contents of a threadâ€™s stack.
- Thread dumps automatically show the occurrence of a deadlock.

10. How does Java handles starvation? 

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

- Using the below methods we can remove the starvation.

`Thread.yield()`-when the thread in the process after releasing the lock gets a fair chance to occupy the C.P.U. and can get time to complete its execution till the original thread again gets the control over the C.P.U.
`Thread.sleep()` -method to given chance to other Threads for execution.

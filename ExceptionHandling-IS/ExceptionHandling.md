The exception object contains a lot of debugging information such as method hierarchy, line number where the exception occurred, type of exception, etc. When the exception occurs in a method, the process of creating the exception object and handing it over to the runtime environment is called "throwing an  exception".Once runtime receives the exception object, it tries to find the handler for the exception. Exception Handler is the block of code that can process the exception object.

we might want to generate exceptions explicitly in our code, for example in a user authentication program we should throw exceptions to clients if the password is null. The throw keyword is used to throw exceptions to the runtime to handle it.

An object representing that exception is created and thrown in the method that caused the error. That method may choose to handle the exception itself, or pass it on. Either way, at some point, the exception is caught and processed. Exceptions can be generated by the Java run-time system, or they can be manually generated by your code.

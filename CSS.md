 <blockquote>

- Both "display: none" and "visibility: hidden" are CSS properties used to hide elements on a web page, but they have different effects.

- The main difference between "display: none" and "visibility: hidden" is that "display: none" completely removes the element from the document flow, whereas "visibility: hidden" hides the element while still taking up space in the document flow.

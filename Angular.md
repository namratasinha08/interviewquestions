1. Angular data binding.

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

Data binding in angular is a way of connect data between component and view. So that changes made in one are automatically reflected in the other. There are four types of data binding in Angular such as interpolation, property binding, event binding, and two-way binding.

2. what is ngModel.

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

The `ngModel` is an Angular directive that provides two-way data binding. It is used to bind the value of an HTML form element to a variable in the component. With `ngModel` any changes made to the input value will be reflected in the component's variable, and changes to the variable will be reflected in the input field.

For example,

```HTML
<input [(ngModel)]="username" name="username" type="text">
```

In the above example, the input field is binded with the username variable present inside the component.

3. observables vs promises

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

An observable and a promise both are used to handle asynchronous operations, but they have differences.

| Promise | Observable | 
| :---------------: | :---------------: | 
|  Promises represent a single value or an error that will be available in the future. | Observables can represent a stream of multiple values that will be available in the future. |  
|  Promises can only be resolved or rejected once. | Observables can emit values multiple times. | 
|  You can chain multiple promises using `.then()` and `.catch()` methods. | Observables can also be chained using methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` | 
|  Promises are not cancellable once they are initiated. | Observables are cancellable using the `unsubscribe()` method. | 
|  Promises are eager, which means they are executed immediately when they are created. | Observables are lazy, which means they only start executing when someone subscribes to them. | 
|  Promises use the `catch()` method to handle errors | Observables use the error callback function. |

5. what are promises

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
A Promise is used to handle asynchronous operations. To understand a Promise in a simpler way, we can consider it as a placeholder for future upcoming values or errors. Promises have three states called pending, fulfilled, or rejected. 

When a Promise is in the pending state, it means that the operation is still in progress and we have not yet received the result. When a Promise is fulfilled, it means that the operation has completed successfully, and the result is available. When a Promise is rejected, it means that the operation has failed and has given us an error. Promises use the `then()` and `catch()` methods to handle the results.

6. what are callback functions.

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function. It is commonly used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations like making an HTTP request. 

example for a callback function,
```js
function add(a, b, callback) {
  const result = a + b;
  callback(result);
}

add(3, 4, function(sum) {
  console.log('sum :', sum);
});

```

In this example, we created a function called add that takes two numbers and a callback function as arguments. Inside the function, we calculate the sum of a and b, and then call the callback function and pass the result to that function.

8. Passing data in Angular?

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

There are several ways to pass data between components in Angular, such as using `input/output bindings`, `services`, `RxJS`, `routing parameters`, and `ViewChild`. `Input and output bindings` are used to pass data between components that have a parent-child relationship. `Services` are used to share data between multiple components. `RxJS` can be used to pass data to components in a reactive way. We can also share data using the URL, and to receive data from the URL we can use `routing parameters`. `ViewChild` is used to access the child component's properties and methods from the parent component.

9. Which decorator is used to declare module in angular

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

The `@NgModule` decorator is used to define a module. The `@NgModule` decorator takes an object as its argument, which includes several properties that define the module's configuration like `declaration`, `imports`,`providers`, and `exports`.

To declare a module using `@NgModule`, you need to create a new TypeScript class, decorate it with `@NgModule`, and then configure the module by setting its properties in the decorator's argument.

for example,
```ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  exports: [
   AppComponent
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }

```

This depends on the use case and requirements of your application. If you have a large amount of data or the data contains sensitive information filtering the data in the backend will be a good option. If you want to enhance the user experience then filtering the data in the front end can be considered as it will reduce the calls to the backend and improves the response time of the application.

In Angular, lazy loading is a technique where instead of loading all the components and modules of an application at once during its initial loading, we load the modules based on their requirement. It is achieved by configuring the application's routing module to load the components or modules asynchronously when needed using the `loadChildren` property. This approach helps to reduce the initial load time of an application and improve performance.

36. What is bind()?

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

In JavaScript, the `bind()` method is used to create a new function with a specified this value. When `bind()` is called on a function, it creates a new function as the original function, but the `this` keyword inside the function will be bound to the first argument of the `bind()` method.

For example,

```js

const myObj = {
  x: 1,
  getX: function() {
    return this.x;
  }
};

const unboundGetX = myObj.getX;
console.log(unboundGetX()); // Output: undefined

const boundGetX = unboundGetX.bind(myObj);
console.log(boundGetX()); // Output: 1

```

In the above example, when we assign the getX method to a variable unboundGetX and call it, the `this` keyword inside the method is not bound to myObj, so it returns undefined. So, We use bind method to bind `this` keyword to myObj.

4.Is there any class in java which help us to create a thread?

A.No.

After extending Thread class, the class should override the run method. After creating object for the class, we can use start() method to run the method.When the method gets started by calling start() method, a new thread is created and starts executed it. On the time, the main thread will continue the remaining part.

2. Why is HQL important?

<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

<blockquote>

- HQL (Hibernate Query Language) is important because it provides a powerful and flexible way to query and manipulate data stored in a relational database using Hibernate. 
- HQL allows developers to write queries using familiar SQL-like syntax, while also supporting advanced features like object-oriented querying and filtering. 
- This makes it easier to work with complex data structures in Java applications, and allows developers to write more efficient and maintainable code.

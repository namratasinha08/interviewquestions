1. What is Unit testing?

<details markdown="1"><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>
    
<blockquote markdown="1">
    
- A method validates a small piece of code.
- It takes the initial data, passes it to the code under test, and asserts if the execution result is the same as the expected result.

2. What is TDD(Test-Driven Development)?

<details markdown="1"><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>
    
<blockquote markdown="1">

- It is a software development approach, where test cases are developed to specify and validate the purpose of code.
- Which will create a test and functionality first and if the code fails then new code will be created 0to make the code pass and to make code bug-free.

3. Explain the lifecycle of TDD.

<details markdown="1"><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>
    
<blockquote markdown="1">

- It has the following phases to go through:
    -Write a test
    -Make it run.
    -Change the code to make it right i.e. Refactor.
    -Repeat process.

4. Explain the stages in the lifecycle of TDD.

<details markdown="1"><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>
    
<blockquote markdown="1">

- Red – during this stage we write a test for functionality that is not yet implemented. 
- Green – during this stage we write enough code to just cover the test. 
- Refactor – during this stage we focus on improving the code quality.

5. Why unit tests are important?

<details markdown="1"><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>
    
 <blockquote markdown="1">

- It is the fast and easy way of testing, since manual checking will consume more time.
- It reduces the total cost and time of software development. 
- It results in Early bugs detection results.

6. Differentiate between TDD and Unit testing.

<details markdown="1"><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>
    
</blockquote>

- TDD focuses on understanding the problem domain and fulfilling the requirements.Whcih must be written before the feature that they cover.
- Whereas, unit tests are to validate the written source code and avoiding bugs and regression. <b>In fact,unit tests are part of the TDD cycle.</b>.Where unit tests can be written at any time, e.g., during or after the feature development.

7. List the types of Unit testing.

<details markdown="1"><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>
    
<blockquote markdown="1">

- <b>Manual Testing</b>-execute the test cases manually without any tool support.Which is time consuming and less relaible
- <b>Automated Testing</b>-execute the test cases with the use of tool support.Which is fast and more relaible.

<details markdown="1"><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>
    
<blockquote markdown="1">

- Which is the testing framework for Java programming language. It is important in test-driven development. 
- Unit testing is used to test/verify a small piece of code by craeting methods. 
- JUnit is to create a set of unit tests that can be run automaticcaly when changes are done in the software.

9. Why we need JUnit testing?

<details markdown="1"><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>
    
 <blockquote markdown="1">

- Makes our code more reliable by finding bugs early in the code.
- It is useful for developers, who work in a test-driven environment.
- Develops more readable, reliable and bug-free code.

<blockquote>

The object-oriented programming is basically a computer programming design philosophy or methodology that organizes/ models software design around data, or objects rather than functions and logic.
An object is referred to as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. Everything in OOP is grouped as self-sustainable objects.It is the most popular programming model among developers. It is well suited for programs that are large, complex, and actively updated or maintained. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing major concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. These core concepts support OOP.

3.What is Polymorphism?

<blockquote>

Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.

There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.

```
- a) Hi-World
- b) Hello-World 
- c) Hi-World
   Hello-World 
- d) Error
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
**Ans:** correct option is a) Hi-World

**Explanation:** In if condition Bitwise xor ^ operator is used which returns 1 if either of the bits are 1 else return 0 if both the bits are 0 or 1. Therefore in the above code, 0 and 1 results in 1 which is true in python. Hence 1st print statement executes.
  </details>

---
14. Which of the following is the correct output?
```
a = 10
b = 4
c = 0
if a || b:
    print("Hi-World")

- c) Hi-World
   Hello-World 
- d) Error
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
**Ans:** correct option is a) Hi-world 

**Explanation:** "Hi-world" is executed because all the if conditions becomes true for the values of 'a' and 'b'. 
  </details>

16. What is the output of the following for loop?
```
for i in 'Akshay':
   if i == 'h':
      break
   print(i, end=", ")
```
- a) A, k, s, h, a, y
- b) A, k, s, h 
- c) A, k, s,
- d) A, k, s 
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
**Ans:** correct option is c) A, k, s, 

**Explanation:** The break statement jumps out of loop when the if condition becomes true i.e when the i value becomes equal to 'h'. So it prints from A till s with comma after each character and comes out of loop and will not print " h, a, y, " of "Akshay" string.
  </details>

---
17. What is the output of the following for loop?
  
```
for i in 'akshay':
   if i == 'a':
      continue
   print(i, end=", ")
```
- a) k, s, h, a, y
- b) a, k, s, h, a, y,
- c) , k, s, h, y
- d) k, s, h, y,
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
**Ans:** correct option is d) k, s, h, y,

**Explanation:** The continue statement skips the current iteration and moves to next iteration when the condition inside if becomes true. Here whenever the value of i becomes equal to a, it will not print the ith value for that iteration and iterates from next iteration. Hence 'a' is not printed anytime in output screen and we get the output as "k, s, h, y,".
  </details>

---
18. What is the output of the following for loop?
```
for i in 'akshay':
   if i == 'a':
      pass
   print(i, end=", ")
```
- a) k, s, h, a, y
- b) a, k, s, h, a, y,
- c) , k, s, h, y
- d) k, s, h, y,
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
**Ans:** correct option is b) a, k, s, h, a, y,

**Explanation:** The pass statement in python does not do anything and therefore all the characters of string is printed with comma(,) at last of each character.
  </details>

--- 
19. Predict the output of the below code.
```
for num in range(8, 12):
   for i in range(2, num):
       if num%i == 1:
          print(num, end=" ")
          break
```
- a) 8
     9
     10
     11
- b) 8 
     9 
     10
- c) 9 
     11
- d) None
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
**Ans:** correct option is a)

**Explanation:** Here in the above code, for each iteration, if the num%i == 1 condition gets true then only it prints the num value and breaks the inner loop and jumps to the outer loop otherwise the i value of inner loop keeps on changing untill i<n or if condition becomes true, whichever comes first. It prints 8 when the value of num and i are 8 and 7 respectively. It prints 9 when the value of num and i are 9 and 2 respectively. It prints 10 when the value of num and i are 10 and 3 respectively. It prints 11 when the value of num and i are 11 and 2 respectively. Hence the correct option is a).   
</details>

---
20. Predict the output of the below code.
```
for num in range(8, 12):
   for i in range(2, num):
       if num%i == 0:
          print(num, end=" ")
          break
```
- a) 8
     9
     10
     11
- b) 8 
     9 
     10
- c) 9 
     11
- d) None
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>

**Ans:** correct option is b)

**Explanation:** Here in the above code, for each iteration, if the num%i == 0 condition gets true then only it prints the num value and breaks the inner loop and jumps to the outer loop otherwise the i value of inner loop keeps on changing untill i<n or if condition becomes true, whichever comes first. It prints 8 when the value of num and i are 8 and 2 respectively. It prints 9 when the value of num and i are 9 and 3 respectively. It prints 10 when the value of num and i are 10 and 2 respectively. For num =11, there is no i value that satisfy the if condition therfore it is not printed. Hence the correct option is b).
</details>

- c) 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1,
- d) 4, 1, -1, -3,
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>

- d) Error 
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
**Ans:** Correct option is a)

**Explanation:** it will print 2 3 4 only not 5 because when the i value becomes 5 it satisfies the if condition and therefore the iteration comes out of loop. 
  </details>

---
28) What will be the output of below code?

```
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
**Ans:** 
```
if(i%2!=0):
     print(i)

---
71. Write your own logic inside the for loop to print the values 7 and 9 in the output screen.
```
list1 = [4, 2, 7, 3, 8, 9, 1]  
for i in list1:  
    # write your logic here
```
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
**Ans:** 
```
if i%2!=0 and i>3:
     print(i)
```    

**Explanation:** i%2!=0 is the condition for printing odd numbers and i> 3 will take the value of i which is greater then 3 and there is a logical 'and' operator between both the if conditions. Therefore when both the conditions becomes true only then the print statement inside if will executes. Hence, we get the final result as 7 and 9.

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
**Ans:** 
```
if i%2==0 or i>3:
     print(i)
```

**Explanation:** i%2==0 is the condition for printing even numbers and i> 3 will take the value of i which is greater then 3 and there is a logical 'or' operator between both the if conditions. Therefore when either of the conditions becomes true only then the print statement inside if will executes. Hence, we get the final result as 4, 2, 7, 8, and 9.

- b) 2
- c) 1 3 5
- d) 2 4 
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
**Ans:** correct option is b) 2 

**Explanation:** The for loop will starts from 1 and goes till 5. In if block break statement is used which break the flow and jumps out of it whenever the if condition becomes true. So for i = 1 it does not print anything as there is no print statement inside for loop after if block, then for i=2 the if condition becames true resulting in executing the break statement. Therefore the current value of i that is 2 is printed by print statement outside for loop.

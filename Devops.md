<blockquote>

CICD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (or Deployment).

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** It is a software development practice in which developers regularly integrate their code changes into a shared repository. With CI, developers can quickly identify and fix integration issues and ensure that the code is always in a stable state. CI tools automate the building and testing of code changes, which helps catch errors earlier in the development process.

- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** It is the process of automatically deploying code changes to production or staging environments after they have passed the necessary tests. CD ensures that the code is always ready for deployment and reduces the risk of introducing errors into the production environment. CD tools automate the deployment of code changes, which helps reduce the time and effort required to release new features and updates.

Together, CI and CD make up the CICD pipeline, which is a set of processes and tools that automate the building, testing, and deployment of software changes. CICD is a key part of modern software development practices and is critical for teams looking to release software quickly and reliably.

- Jenkis, Github Actions, GitLabs and Codebuild and CodeDeploy in AWS are few CI/CD tools.

<details><summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) API is a messaging protocol used for exchanging structured data between web services over the internet. It is based on XML and provides a standardized way for different systems to communicate with each other. SOAP messages consist of an envelope that contains information about the message, followed by a body that contains the message payload. SOAP API is often used in enterprise environments where interoperability and security are critical concerns.

2. Is SOAP better then REST?


<details><summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

Whether SOAP API is better than REST API or not depends on the specific requirements and use case of your application. If your application requires a strict message format, built-in error handling and security, and is used in an enterprise environment, then SOAP may be a better choice. If your application requires a lightweight payload, simple API design, and is targeted towards mobile or IoT devices, then REST may be a better choice.

Yes, it is possible for two or more APIs to connect to one web page or application. This is often done by integrating the APIs into the application using appropriate libraries or frameworks. In angular it can be achieved by serices, which can have multiple API calls and those services can be injected in any component.

Show Answer:

d) By Combining Savepoint and Rollback command

Savepoint is a command in MySQL that is like a Restore Point in Windows i.e., If an error occurs it rollbacks to the point where the restore point was created, Likewise in MySQL if we want to go to a point we will be using the
ROLLBACK TO [SAVEPOINT NAME];

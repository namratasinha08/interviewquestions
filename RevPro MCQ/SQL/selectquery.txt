A.10

B.5

C.9

D.0
Answer:5
Explanation:Each non-NULL value in the SALARY column of the employee table's 10 records is distinct, i.e. different. As a result, out of those ten records, one must be a minimum and cannot exceed any of the nine values in the pay column. 
So, nine times will the condition WHERE SALARY > ANY (SELECT SALARY FROM employee) be true. The COUNT(\*) returns 9.

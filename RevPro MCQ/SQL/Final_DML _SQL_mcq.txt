49.Data types in a database table specify the type of ______________ that can be stored there.

Data

Table

Number

None of the above

Answer: Data

Explanation:

Data is categorised into different types by a data type, which informs the compiler or interpreter of the programmer's intended usage of the data.



50.One row of data can be entered manually or several rows can be added as a result of a query using the ADD command.

a. True
b. False

Correct Answer: False

Explanation:
To insert new data into a table, use the `INSERT` command. Following the execution of the command, Sql will create a new row. Single quotes should be used to encapsulate the date and string values.



51.A database is defined using data manipulation language (DML) commands, which can be used to add constraints and create, modify, and delete tables.

a. True
b. False

Correct Answer: False

Explanation:
*DML commands consist of the following: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. 

*They can be used to perform record searches, add fresh entries to the database, edit already-existing records, or remove records entirely.



52.In a table, which of the following columns cannot be updated?

a. A primary key column which also serves as foreign key reference in another table
b. Columns which allows NULL values in the table
c. DATE type columns in the table
d. All of the above

Correct Answer : A

Explanation:

The following columns in a table cannot be modified because they are primary key columns that are also used as foreign key references in other tables.

53.An SQL INSERT statement inserts ______________records into any single table in a relational database.

a. One
b. two
c. One or More
d. None of Above

Correct Answer: One or More

Explanation:

The SQL INSERT INTO Statement is used to insert new rows of data into a database table.

54.An INSERT statement can also be used to retrieve data from another source, alter it as needed, and then insert it directly into the table.

a. True
b. False

Correct Answer: True

Explanation:

* The INSERT INTO SELECT statement copies the information from one table and  then inserts it into another table. 
* The data types in the source and target tables must match for the INSERT INTO SELECT statement to work.

55.SQL Insert  statement does not allow us  to add data to specified columns.

a. True
b. False

Correct Answer: False

Explanation:

The INSERT INTO command can be written in two ways: 1. INSERT INTO table name specifies both the column names and the values to be inserted and the syntax is,  INSERT INTO table name (column1, column2, column3, ...)

56.If the table definition allows it, you can also omit columns from an INSERT operation.

a. True
b. False

Correct Answer: True

Explanation:

* The INSERT command accepts up to three column names and values. 
* We must provide three essential  bits of information when utilising an INSERT statement: The name of the table in which we want to store data. 
* The names of the columns to which we are adding data.

57.To filter the data to be inserted, the SELECT statement used in an INSERT SELECT can include a ___________________clause.

a. Into
b. From
c. Where
d. Both A & B

Correct Answer: Where

Explanation:

You can utilise a select-statement within an INSERT statement to insert zero, one, or more rows from the select-result statement's table into a table. 
The select-statement contained within the INSERT statement is identical to the select-statement used to obtain data.

58.SELECT INTO inserts data into a____________table.

a. Only System table
b. Old        
c. New
d. Both A & B

Correct Answer: New

Explanation:

* The SELECT INTO statement creates a new table and update it with rows from the query. 
* we use the WHERE clause to define which rows to duplicate if you want to copy partial data from the source table.

59.To create the backup copies of tables, we can  use the __________ statement.

A) SELECT INTO
B) SELECT IN 
C) SELECT IO
D) SELECT TO 

Correct Answer: SELECT INTO

Explanation: 

60.Because of the SELECT_________INTO query does not specify a primary key for the new table, so we may need to do so manually.

a. True
b. False

Correct Answer: True

Explanation:

The INTO clause provides one or more variables that it will receive the values returned by the query and  If it returns some multiple values, and they are assigned to the list of variables in the order that they are specified.

61.A SELECT INTO statement must return only one row by default.

a. True
b. False

Correct Answer: True

Explanation:

The SELECT INTO statement transfers data from one table to another table.

62.What is the purpose of the following query?

```sql

select distinct e1."FirstName"
into NewTable
from "employee" e1

```

a. The query returns all names from the field "FirstName" including duplicates and places it inside a new table giving it name "NewTable".
b. The query returns all names from the field "FirstName" excluding duplicates and places it inside a new table giving it name "mynewtable"
c. The query returns all names from the field "FirstName" excluding duplicates and places it inside a new table giving it name "NewTable".
d. Both A & C

Correct Answer:

The query returns all names from the field "FirstName" excluding duplicates and places it inside a new table giving it name "NewTable".

63.What is the fundamental syntax for the Delete query?

a. Delete * from tablename;
b. Delete From table_name Where some_condition; 
c. Delete from tablename;
d. None of the above.

Correct Answer:  Delete From table_name Where some_condition; 

Explanation:

table name: the table's name some condition: a condition for selecting a certain record.
Depending on the condition we specify inside the WHERE clause, we can delete a single record or more than a two records. 

64.Which clause in the DELETE statement causes the delete to be performed within specific criteria?

a. Where 
b. Group
c. Group By

65.Is TOP keyword is utilized in the Delete Query?

a. True

67.Does the remove statement keep the lock?

a. True
b. False

Correct Answer: True

Explanation: 

During execution, the DELETE statement employs a row lock. Every row in the table is protected from deletion  and its  filters can be specified in the WHERE clause,  If the WHERE condition is true, the command deletes the specified data.

68.Delete statements either lock the entire table or a single row at a time?

a. Delete never locks any table or row.
b. Delete never locks any row while deleting.
c. Delete locks both Row and table.
d. Delete locks only Row.

Correct Answer: Delete locks only Row.

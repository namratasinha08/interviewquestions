2. We need to import java.util.stream even after importing java.util.* in the code to use stream API?

A. True
B. False

Answer: A 
Explantion: java.util.* will import all the direct classes and interfaces but not sub-classes/sub-packages.Stream class resides in the sub package java.util.stream package so it will not be included in java.util.*.

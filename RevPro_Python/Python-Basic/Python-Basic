3.Which of the following statement is false regarding Identifiers?

a)Variable name can have lower and upper case letters.
b)Identifier should start with a character or a number. 
c)A digit(0-9) can be placed at any position except at the starting. 
d)No special characters(@,!,#,$,%,&) are allowed other than underscore. 

Answer:B

12.Predict the output for the following code.

a = 9
b = 5
  
print(a and b) 
print(a & b) 

a) 5  
&emsp;5  
b) 5  
&emsp;1   
c) 9   
&emsp;9  
d) 9   
&emsp;0    

Answer: B
 
Explanation:In the first print statement, logical "and" operator is used, which checks if both operand values are non- zero and it will return the value of operand mentioned in the last i.e 'b=5'. In the second print statement, bitwise operator '&' is used, which converts the operand values to binary[ in terms of 0 and 1] and compares and returns 1 if both the bits are 1 otherwise, it returns 0. So, a=9 in binary is 1001 and b=5 in binary is 0101. Therefore after comparing both operand values bit by bit, we get final result as 0001 in binary which is equal to 1 in decimal format. Hence, the output (b).

17.Predict the output of the following code.
  
value =  10//2**3*3+4/2
print(value) 

a) 377   
b) 5  
c) 5.0   
d) 2 
  
Show Answer:C
Explanation:According to precedence of operators, Exponent(**) has the highest precedence in this expression. After that Multiplication(*), Division(/), Floor division(//) all three have same precedence so, it is evaluated from left to right order in an expression, finally ending with Addition(+). So 2**3 will get evaluated first which gives,'8'. Then 10//8 gives 1 because of floor division, 1*3 gives '3' and 4/2 gives '2.0'. Hence, the final result will come out as 3+2.0 = 5.0

Answer:B                        

Explanation:In both the print statements Bitwise operators are used. In first print statement, bitwise or operator is used which converts values of a and b in binary and returns 1 if either of the bit is 1 else 0. Binary value of 5 is 0101 and binary value of 10 is 1010 so the resultant will be 1111 in binary which is equivalent to 15 in decimal. Therefore 1st print statement prints 15 as output. In 2nd print statement Bitwise right shift operator is used which shifts the bits of a number to the right and fills 0 on voids left. So 1010 is shifted twice to the right as mentioned in print statement.

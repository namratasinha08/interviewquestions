15. What is the output of the following for loop?

A. J, e, r, r, y,   
B. J, e, r, r, y  
C. J, e,  
D. J, e, y,  

  
Answer: C

Explanation:  The break statement jumps out of loop when the if condition becomes true i.e when the i value becomes equal to 'r'. So it prints from J till e with comma after each character and comes out of loop and will not print " r, r, y, " of "Jerry" string.

A. J, e, r, r, y,   
B. J, e, r, r, y  
C. J, e,  
D. J, e, y,  


Answer: D

Explanation:  The continue statement skips the current iteration and moves to next iteration when the condition inside if becomes true. Here whenever the value of i is equal to r, it will not print the ith value for that iteration and iterates from next iteration. Hence, 'r' is not printed anytime in output screen and we get the output as "J, e, y,".

A. 8 9 10 11   
B. 8 9 10   
C. 9 11  
D. None  
  
Answer: A

Explanation:  Here in the above code, for each iteration, if the num%i == 1 condition gets true then only it prints the num value and breaks the inner loop and jumps to the outer loop otherwise the i value of inner loop keeps on changing untill i<n or if condition becomes true, whichever comes first. It prints 8 when the value of num and i are 8 and 7 respectively. It prints 9 when the value of num and i are 9 and 2 respectively. It prints 10 when the value of num and i are 10 and 3 respectively. It prints 11 when the value of num and i are 11 and 2 respectively. Hence the correct option is A..

It prints 8 when the value of num and i are 8 and 2 respectively. It prints 9 when the value of num and i are 9 and 3 respectively. It prints 10 when the value of num and i are 10 and 2 respectively. For num =11, there is no i value that satisfy the if condition therfore it is not printed. Hence the correct option is B..

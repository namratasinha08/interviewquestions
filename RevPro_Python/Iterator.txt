2. Predict the output of the following code.

class Numbers:
    def __iter__(self):
        self.a = 8
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.a <= 5:
            x = self.a
            self.a += 1
            return x
        else:
            raise StopIteration

obj = Numbers()
itr = iter(obj)

for x in itr:
        print(x, end=" ")

A. 5 6 7 8
B. 8 7 6 5
C. Error
D. Nothing is printed

Answer: D

Explanation: As the current value of a is more than 5, it will raise StopIteration exception and prints nothing in output screen.

3. Predict the output for the following code.

class Numbers:
    def __iter__(self):
        self.a = 3
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.a <= 5:
            x = self.a
            self.a += 1
            return x
        else:
            raise StopIteration

obj = Numbers()
itr = iter(obj)

for x in itr:
        print(x, end=" ")


A. 3 4 5
B. 5 4 3
C. Error
D. Nothing is printed

Answer: A

Explanation: The initial value of a is 3 and it will increment by 1 until it reaches 5 in __next__() method. Therefore, we will get 3, 4 and 5 as an output.

7.  What is the output of the following code?

y = 6
z = lambda x: x ** y
print (z(7))


A. 117648
B. 117647
C. 117650
D. 117649

Answer: D

Explanation: The lambda keyword creates an anonymous function. The x is a parameter that is passed to the lambda function and the parameter is followed by a colon character. The code next to the colon is the expression that is executed when the lambda function is called and, the lambda function is assigned to the z variable. The lambda function is executed. The number 7 is passed to the anonymous function and it returns 117649 as the result. Note that z is not a name for this function and it is only a variable to which the anonymous function was assigned.

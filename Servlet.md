<blockquote>

JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology used to create dynamic web pages in Java. It allows you to combine static HTML with Java code to generate dynamic content on the server-side, which is then sent to the client-side for display in a web browser.

JSP pages can be used to create a wide variety of web-based applications, including e-commerce sites, content management systems, social media platforms, and more.

JSP pages can also be combined with other Java technologies, such as JavaBeans, servlets, and tag libraries, to create even more powerful web-based applications.

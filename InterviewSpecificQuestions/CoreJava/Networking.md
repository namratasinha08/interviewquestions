<blockquote>


Client-side and server-side coding refer to the location where the code is executed.

Client-side coding is executed on the user's computer, usually in a web browser. Client-side code includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This code is used to build user interfaces, handle user interactions, and perform simple client-side operations, such as form validation.

Server-side coding is executed on the server-side, which is usually a web server. Server-side code includes programming languages like Java, Python, Ruby, and PHP. This code is used to handle complex operations, such as processing data, connecting to databases, and handling user authentication.

A client-side bug may include issues related to user input validation, page rendering, or browser compatibility, while a server-side bug may include issues related to database interaction, server configuration, or application logic. Examples of client-side bugs include unhandled user input or unsupported browser versions, while examples of server-side bugs may include incorrect database queries, server crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

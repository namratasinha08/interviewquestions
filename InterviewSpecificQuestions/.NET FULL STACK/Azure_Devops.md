- Process and transform the data
- Save the processed data to a staging location for others to consume


- Data pipelines in the enterprise can evolve into more complicated scenarios with multiple source systems and supporting various downstream applications.

- Data pipelines provide:

`Consistency`: Data pipelines transform data into a consistent format for users to consume
Error reduction: Automated data pipelines eliminate human errors when manipulating data
`Efficiency`: Data professionals save time spent on data processing transformation. Saving time allows then to focus on their core job function - getting the insight out of the data and helping business makes better decisions.

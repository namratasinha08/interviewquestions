1. What are the sublanguages of SQL.


<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing relational databases. There are several sub-languages of SQL, each with its own syntax and purpose. 

- Data Definition Language (DDL): DDL is used to define and modify the structure of a database. It includes commands such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP, which are used to create, modify, and delete tables, views, indexes, and other database objects.

- Data Manipulation Language (DML): DML is used to manipulate the data stored in a database. It includes commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, which are used to retrieve, add, modify, and remove data from tables.

- Data Query Language (DQL):  DQL is used to retrieve data from a database. DQL is a subset of the larger Data Manipulation Language (DML) and includes commands such as SELECT, which is used to query data from one or more tables in a database.

- Data Control Language (DCL): DCL is used to control access to a database. It includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE, which are used to grant and revoke privileges to users and roles.

- Transaction Control Language (TCL): TCL is used to manage transactions in a database. It includes commands such as COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT, which are used to commit or rollback changes made to a database.

2. What is an Alias?

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

In SQL, an alias is a temporary name assigned to a table or column in a query. Aliases can be used to make column names more meaningful or to distinguish between multiple tables with similar names.

Aliases are created using the AS keyword, which is optional. Here's an example of creating an alias for a table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees AS emp;
```
In this example, the table "employees" is given the alias "emp". From this point forward in the query, the table can be referred to as "emp" instead of "employees". This can make the query more readable and easier to understand.

Aliases can also be used for columns. Here's an example:
```sql
SELECT first_name AS "First", last_name AS "Last" FROM employees;
```
In this example, the column "first_name" is given the alias "First", and the column "last_name" is given the alias "Last". This can be useful for making the column names more descriptive or easier to read.

Aliases are a powerful feature in SQL that can be used to make queries more readable and easier to understand.

3. What is a record type?

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>
In SQL, a record type is a user-defined data type that represents a collection of related values. A record type is similar to a struct in other programming languages, and it allows you to define a custom data structure with its own fields and data types.

To define a record type in SQL, you use the CREATE TYPE statement. Here's an example:
```sql
CREATE TYPE person_type AS (
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
```
In this example, we define a record type called "person_type" with three fields: "first_name", "last_name", and "email". Each field has its own data type, which is specified after the field name.

Once you have defined a record type, you can use it as a data type for columns in tables or as a return type for stored procedures and functions. Here's an example of using the "person_type" record type as a column type:
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    name person_type
);
```
In this example, we define a table called "employees" with two columns: "id" and "name". The "name" column is of type "person_type", which means it can store values with the same structure as the "person_type" record type we defined earlier.

Record types are a powerful feature in SQL that allow you to define custom data structures and make your database schema more expressive and easier to understand.
